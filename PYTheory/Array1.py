#An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
#Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.
#numpy library can also be used to build arrays in python
#numpy is specifically designed for numerical data and scientific computing.
array1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(array1)

#using numpy
import numpy as np
arr1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
