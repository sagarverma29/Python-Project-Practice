# Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
# A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
# any python file saved with .py, can be imported into another file by using "import" statement'
# When using a function from a module, use the syntax: module_name.function_name.
#You can create an alias when you import a module, by using the as keyword:
import Functions # importing Functions.py
#Functions.func2 # calling func2 function
f = "sag"
Functions.MyFunction(f)
